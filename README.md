# Sentiment-Prediction-using-Neural-Networks
Sentiment classification by designing a neural network | DL for NLP Course Project 	   (Feb’21 –April’21)

•	Utilized Fasttext, Word2vec and GloVe embeddings to embody linguistic meaning of word into its representation

•	Implemented & analyzed results using different models (FFNN, LSTM, GRU, BERT) via F1-Score & LIME explainer

•	Tested techniques viz. SMOTE, Over-sampling, Under-sampling, and class-weights for tackling imbalance in data
